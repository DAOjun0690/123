Problem statement
---
Research building want a central air conditioning system to maintain comfort for each room. It should control wind volume according to the temperature and humidity of room, and it should have screens in the room shows current apparent temperature, humidity and wind volume.User may setting Apparent temperature with remote controller.

Our case describe a central air conditioning system in a research building for controlling each room in building are keep in a comfort temperature. According to the requirement above, this system have screens in each room to show current apparent temperature, humidity and wind volume. The system also provide remote controller for user to setting desired apparent temperature or shutting down usage.



Decompose the problem into subproblems
---
1. measure and store temperature, humidity and wind volume of each room
2. specify the temperature, humidity and wind volume of each room 
3. Display current room temperature, humidity, and wind volume on the screen in each room
4. Display all room temperature, humidity and wind volume on the screen in the central air conditioning system
5. automatically adjust temperature, humidity and wind volume of rooms
7. Remote control
6. Turn off the power automatically when no room were in use
 
<!-- 演講內容
We decomposition this problem into four subproblems, which as the following are
1 title -> describe content: each room has a screen shows current apparent temperature, humidity, wind volume and target apparent temperature for user.
2 title -> describe content: how system work to auto adjust wind volume for each room according to the target apparent temperatue.
3 title -> describe content: how system calculate needed temperature of a room according to the vital fact read by the sensors.
4 title -> describe content: user may use remote controller to set target apparent temperature.
5 title -> describe content: detect if there is no room in use, shut down the air conditioner for energy saving.
in this project, we will focus on the first two subproblems -->
